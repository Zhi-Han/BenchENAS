# Contributing to BenchENAS

Being an open source project, BenchENAS welcomes all kinds of contribution to keep it growing and thriving. Everyone can contribute, and we value every contribution. Thank you for your interest! You can contribute to the BenchENAS project in a wide range of ways. You can also reach us via <a href="mailto:benchenas99&#64;gmail.com">email</a> if needed. The participation in this open source project is subject to [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/benchenas/BenchENAS/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

It is also an incentive to the developers if you can acknowledge BenchENAS whenever it helps you. You can refer the library in your blog or papers, or star the repository to say "thank you".

## Typical Contributions
Here are some typical contributions you can make. All of them are equally important to the project.

- New features
- Datasets and Algorithms
- Application solutions
- Documents and tutorials
- Bug fixes

Implementation is not always required. You can also write proposals and discuss them with the community.

If you are a new open source contributor, we recommend you to take a look at these [guidelines](https://www.contribution-guide.org/).

## Submit an Issue
See the [ReadMe](https://github.com/benchenas/BenchENAS/blob/master/README.md) for installation instructions. Your contribution can start as light as asking questions.

Ask any questions about BenchENAS on the [BenchENAS's GitHub Issues tab](https://github.com/benchenas/BenchENAS/issues) and we will discuss and answer you there. Questions help us identify *blind spots* in our development and can greatly improve the code quality.

We strongly recommend you to search the issue board before you submit any new issue. Sometimes the same issue may have been solved and you can find the solution in a closed issue.

Be as concrete as possible. For issues or bug reports, this means you are supposed to include all relevant information, such as code snippets, logs and package versions. For feature requests, please clearly describe the motivation, and possible scenarios for the feature.

## Make a pull request

You can contribute code to the project through [pull requests](https://github.com/benchenas/BenchENAS/pulls). To make a pull request, you need

- [Fork the BenchENAS repository](https://github.com/benchenas/BenchENAS/fork)
- Clone it to your local computer
- Implement your code and test it
- Push it to your GitHub repository
- [Create a pull request](https://github.com/benchenas/BenchENAS/pulls) in BenchENAS

If your forked repository is behind the latest version, you can create a pull request in your repository to pull the latest version from BenchENAS.

You can directly make a pull request for trivial changes. For non-trivial changes, it is better to discuss it in an issue before you implement the code.

## Code Style
We aim to design the core modules to be highly reusable, generic, and customizable, and follow these guidelines:
- Follow the [continuous integration practice](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration#about-continuous-integration) to make small changes and commit frequently with clear descriptions for others to understand what you have done. This can detect errors sooner, reduce debugging needs, make it easier to merge changes, and eventually save the overall time.
- Use highly readable names for variables, functions, and classes. Using verbs is preferred when feasible for compactness. Use spell check with US English setting, e.g., [Grazie](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/tree/master/plugins/grazie) in PyCharm and [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) in VS code.
- Write test cases for modified or added parts of code. ```test```
- If high-quality existing code from other sources are used, add credit and license information at the top of the file.

### Recommended development software
- Python IDE: Visual Studio Code, PyCharm
- GitHub: GitHub Desktop (for Windows/Mac), GitKraken (for Linux), GitHub guides, GitHub documentations
